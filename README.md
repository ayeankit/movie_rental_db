Explore Sakila DVD Rental database

### Description
The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs.
In this project, we query the PostgreSQL database to answer below questions:

* Compare the number of movies within each combination of family-friendly
 categories based on rental duration category.
*  How do the stores compare in their count of rental orders during
  every month for all years?
* Who are the top 5 paying customers in 2007, and what was the amount
   of their monthly payments?
* Out of the top 10 paying customers in 2007, who paid the maximum
   difference between two consecutive months?
